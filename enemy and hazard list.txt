*this signifies its probably not needed and would just be a cool extra thing we could do
 if we feel that the game is too basic with just these enemies

by ryan who is doing level design



normal turret

explosive turret (normal but slower, less accurate and covers area of effect)

access point (not an enemy, just a thing to shoot to break down planet/blow up)

anglerfish chase

mothership (strollin round hub, undamageable)

 - > spawned miniships (fly around like player but slower, 
	probably same/slightly faster fire rate, 2 or 3 at a time)

weird final boss thing that i have a sketch of in my bag
	(has normal turret shot, explosive turret shot, *row/column shot,
	 rotating energy shields)



trap stuff: 
   *sandworm/worm-like thing that acts as a moving wall basically, simple hazard

   crumbling planet that player has to move through (will probably just tie this
	into ice planet, moving througha tunnel, shoot point, blow up that portion of level,
	move thru to next)

   sandfall area or something that slows down player movement and intensifies gravity
